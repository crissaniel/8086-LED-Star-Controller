# SWITCHES
The LED animations are controlled by 4 switches, although it is 5 in the simulation, it is labelled as "DISREGARD" and is to be kept open at all times. Reason for it to be there is for scalability, if perhaps you'd like to implement a ramp up speed feature and etc.

# CONTROLS
| Switch | Function                          |
|--------|-----------------------------------|
| SW1    | ON/OFF master control             |
| SW2    | Toggle play/pause of animations   |

| SW4 | SW5 | LED Behavior |
|-----|-----|--------------|
|  0  |  0  | LEDs blinking |
|  0  |  1  | Alternating sequence of colors R ↔ B ↔ Y |
|  1  |  0  | CW rotation of B & Y LEDs, CCW rotation of R LEDs |
|  1  |  1  | CW loop d' loop pattern |
